# Mazes of Erebor

### Motivation

Let's learn C++.

We will build an old-school text-only adventure game; solving mazes. It will be built using `ncurses` and I won't bother trying to support Windows.

Each branch of this repository has an increasingly fun game.  And for each branch we will have to learn more about C++ to create the game we want.

### The Game - This Branch

Navigate an effectively infinite number of unique mazes.

1. Run the program and a maze is printed to an `ncurses` window.
2. Select your maze difficulty.
3. Use arrow keys to naviage your maze.
4. When you read the end of a maze you will find yourself in a newer, larger maze.
5. No plot, no side quests, just mazes. Forever.
6. Type `q` to quit.
