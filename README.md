# Mazes of Erebor

### Motivation

I wanted to learn C++, so I decided to build a classic text adventure game. This will be a text-only game involving mazes, probably in the arcade style. It will be built on `ncurses` and will only support Linux, Unix, or MacOS (this is a learning project, I see no reason to fiddle with Windows).
